How to automatically run a script in bash
#########################################

1. 'cd' to the root of our home directory '~/'
2. Enter the command 'ls -a' and confirm the hidden file '.bashrc' is present
    - '.bashrc' runs every time the bash terminal is opened
    - Editing this file allows you to configure various aspects of the bash terminal
    - If we add the absolute path to one of our '.sh' scripts into this file, the script will be executed whenever the '.bashrc' runs (every time we open a new terminal)
3. Enter the command 'vim .bashrc'
4. At the end of the file input the absolute path to the chosen script:
    - '~/absolute/path/to/chosen/script.sh'
5. Press '<esc>' and input ':wq' to save the file and close vim
6. To force a terminal restart, input the command 'bash' or simply open a new terminal.
7. If done correctly, the script should run and any expected output from the script should be visible in the terminal.
